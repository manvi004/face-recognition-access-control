This module documents the database layer used for persistent storage of user information and access records using MySQL.

MySQL is used to provide persistent storage for registered users
and to maintain logs of all access attempts.

The database ensures:
1. User data persistence across power cycles
2. Support for multiple registered users
3. Traceability of authentication attempts
